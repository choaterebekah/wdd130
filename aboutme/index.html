    <h2>Rebekah Choate</h2>
    <h2>Bekah</h2>
    <p>I am currently studying computer science, although I have my associates in psychology. I'm experimenting with what would be the best route that can lead me to be able to make apps, websites, and other technology that will help people with their mental and physical health.</p>
